# PhoneAddressServer

In creating the database system, mongoose along with mongodb was used to host the server and for me to connect to it.

In using Ionic serve within the server folder it allowed the server to run on local host 1337

When using npm start it thus started the application itself and started to help bring up the Ionic application itself.

# How the Code works summary

Once the app is up and running on local host what will happen is that one should be able to create a user, delete a user, read the data that is occurring and update the user as well.

Along with Search functionality and Sorting, a list of contacts was already created for everyone to see
